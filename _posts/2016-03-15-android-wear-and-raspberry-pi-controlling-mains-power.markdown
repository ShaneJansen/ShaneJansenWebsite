This is an extension of the
<a href="/raspberry-pi-controlling-mains-power/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Controlling Mains Power Project.</a>
The Android and Android Wear apps allow you to control any number of devices.  There is an Apache server running
on the Raspberry Pi with a REST API available to the applications.  There are two endpoints on the REST API which
are "get-state" (gets a list and current state of devices) and "set-state" (set the state of a particular device).
